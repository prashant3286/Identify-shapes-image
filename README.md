3. Go to terminal and type the following command to start the project:

    *python3 script/shaping.py --image images/inputs/red_rectangle.jpg* 

1.  shaping.py is script file
2.  images/inputs/ is the path where the input images are located
3. --image is the argument

**Project Outcomes:**
1. It can be helpful in detecting proper shape from image when it is required.
